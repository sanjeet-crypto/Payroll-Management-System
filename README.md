A payroll management system is the process by which employers pay wages to their employees. It‚Äôs also how they demonstrate their commitment to their workers, fulfill their obligations to government agencies and keep financial records in order.Payroll management is an important part of any business because it helps improve employee engagement and regulatory compliance. Without an efficient, accurate means of paying employees, depositing and filing taxes, and maintaining records, employers could face wage claims and expensive penalties.

## About the Project ‚õπÔ∏è‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
To analyse the water quality, I have used a Kaggle dataset that contains data on all of the major factors that affect the potability of water. All of the factors that affect water quality are very important, so I have briefly explored each feature of this dataset before training the machine learning model to predict whether a water sample is safe or unsuitable for consumption.

## Summary
Through this project  we can analyze the quality of water and train a machine learning model to classify safe and unsafe water for drinking. Access to safe drinking water is one of the essential needs of all human beings. From a legal point of view, access to drinking water is one of the fundamental human rights. Many factors affect water quality, it is also one of the major research areas in machine learning.

# Payroll Management System
The project has multiple classes and sub-classes with many features within them. Basic operations users can perform via this program project that are based on file handling are adding new employee record, modifying employee record and deleting record, displaying one or all employee‚Äôs record. Besides these, payroll management also allows users to print the salary slip for a particular employee. This project is large, complete and we tried our best to make it error-free. The source code is very long ‚Äì over 1500 lines and developed in Code Blocks compiler.

# Project Operations
Addition of New Employee:  

This feature is under the public functions of class employee. The information handled in this feature are employee code number, name, address, phone number, joining date (day, month and year), designation, grade and loan.

Modify Employee Record: 

  This System in C++ asks for employee code from the user for this function to work. Modifications that can be made are the employee code number itself, joining date (day, month and year), name, address, phone number, designation, grade, house allowance and loan given to the employee. Employee‚Äôs grades are categorized as A, B, C, D and E.

Delete Employee Record: 

  Deletion is done of an employee record from Payroll management system project by entering the employee code. A confirmation message is asked stating whether the user really wants to delete the record from the file.

Print Employee Salary Slip:
  
  This feature too asks for the employee code; the employee code has been used to unlock or perform operations in many features of this payroll management system project in C++. This function lists all the months of the year, and asks for date, employee name, designation and grade from the user. To print the salary slip, the user further needs to provide information such as number of days worked in the month by the employee and the number of hours worked over time. The slip enlists basic salary, allowance, deductions and net salary of the employee.

Display Employee Record:

 Providing the employee code number, users can access all the provided information related to a particular employee via this function. The employee record information displayed are the ones provided while adding a new employee record.

Display List of Employees:

  This feature displays the record of all employees added in file. The records are displayed in a tabular pattern containing information such as code name of the employee, phone number, date of joining, designation, grade and salary.
